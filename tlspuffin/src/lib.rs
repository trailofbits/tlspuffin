//!
//! ### Used protocol and cryptographic libraries
//!
//! In order to easily implement concrete functions, we use several libraries which provide us with predefined encoders for TLS packets, cryptographic primitives, as well as higher level cryptographic operations specific for TLS.
//!
//! We forked the [rustls](https://github.com/ctz/rustls) library for cryptographic operations like deriving secrets. We also use it to encode and decode TLS messages.
//!
//! The cryptographic library [ring](https://github.com/briansmith/ring) allows us to use the derived secrets to encrypt and decrypt TLS messages.
